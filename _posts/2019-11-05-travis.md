In this post I'll show a very simple way of using the [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) continuous-integration system to test a project via Docker.
This is _not_ a description of building Docker containers using Travis.
Specifically, the setup is:

* you have a project at GitHub which contains a Dockerfile describing how to install your project's dependencies into a Docker image
* you have some means of building and testing that project within the corresponding Docker container
* you would like this build/test to happen automatically on push.

For background on how to set up the first two steps, see [a previous post about Docker]({% post_url 2018-04-19-docker %}).


## Travis

Travis is an industry-standard continuous-integration (CI) service that is nicely integrated with GitHub.
It can do all sorts of fancy pipelines, but here we'll just get it to do one simple thing: run a command in a Docker container.

We'll use the same [cowsay-test](https://github.com/matsen/cowsay-test) repository as in the [previous post]({% post_url 2018-04-19-docker %}).
This time let's look at the `.travis.yml` file in that repository, which is in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format:

```yaml
language: minimal

services:
  - docker

script:
  - docker run -t matsen/cowsay-test /bin/bash -c "cowsay hello"
```

Travis has all sorts of preconfigured machines to run code in a variety of languages.
In the first line, we are specifying that we want to use a "minimal" machine, which isn't designed for a specific language.
This image just has [a collection of standard tools, including Docker](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/minimal-and-generic/).
The second block specifies that we would like to use Docker.

The third and final block specifies what command we'd like Travis to run.
It runs `cowsay hello` via bash inside the `matsen/cowsay-test` Docker image from Docker Hub.

We can test this locally with a local clone of the repository.
If we want to test the whole process, we can execute a `docker build -t matsen/cowsay-test .` command inside the repository, and then copy and paste the `docker run` command from the `.travis.yml` file (without the leading `-`).
If we want to test the version that's on Docker Hub, we can instead do `docker pull -t matsen/cowsay-test`.

To automate this process for any repository, we just need these files, and to:

* set up an automated build on Docker Hub [as described previously]({% post_url 2018-04-19-docker %}#automated-builds)
* make an account on <travis-ci.org>, signing in via your GitHub account
* go to <https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories> and find the repository you want to test
* click on the switch to activate testing of your repository
* click on the hamburger menu button (â˜°) in the upper right, and select "Trigger build" using the default values
* add a Travis badge (see the cowsay-test repository for an example that makes the badge a link to your build page)


## Using quay.io

Docker-the-software is great.
Docker-the-company is [struggling somewhat](https://www.zdnet.com/article/docker-is-in-deep-trouble/) and it shows in that Docker Hub is slow and sometimes unreliable.
[quay.io](https://quay.io/) is an alternative service that we are starting to use moving forwards.

If you want to try it out, fork the [cowsay-test](https://github.com/matsen/cowsay-test) repository on GitHub then:

* make an account
* click on "Create New Repository" on the upper right of your user page
* name your repository in the text box
* Follow the prompts, selecting
    * Public repository
    * Link to a GitHub Repository Push
    * Select your forked repository
    * your Dockerfile is `/Dockerfile` as per the help on the right hand side
    * your build context is just `/` as per the help on the right hand side
* Continue to the page for your build
* Select "Start New Build"

On the Travis side, all you need to do is to add `quay.io/` to the start of your Docker image name, like so:

```yaml
script:
  - docker run -t quay.io/matsen/cowsay-test /bin/bash -c "cowsay hello"
```


## Adding Conda

[Conda](http://conda.io) is a great cross-platform package manager that has a lot of traction.
You can incorporate Conda as follows, which I'll describe using the example [astronaut-requests](https://github.com/matsen/astronaut-requests) repository.
This example uses the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) Python library to fetch the collection of astronauts currently in space.

We just need one more file, which is the `environment.yml` file.
This file [specifies your Conda dependencies](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually).
It's a helpful file for folks to have in general if they wish to install your software via conda, as they can just execute

    conda env create -f environment.yml

and get a Conda environment ready for them.
In the [example environment.yml file](https://github.com/matsen/astronaut-requests/blob/master/environment.yml) I show how to combine pip and conda.

The [astronaut-requests Dockerfile](https://github.com/matsen/astronaut-requests/blob/master/Dockerfile) just builds the corresponding Conda environment:

```docker
FROM continuumio/anaconda3:2019.07

COPY environment.yml .

RUN /opt/conda/bin/conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Here we use the `continuumio/anaconda3:2019.07` base image (using a specific tag is a good idea to avoid future breakage!).
We then copy the `environment.yml` file in from the repository, and use it to make our Conda environment.
Note that we need to use the full path to `conda`.
In our case it creates a Conda environment called `requests`.

The [astronaut-requests Travis YAML file](https://github.com/matsen/astronaut-requests/blob/master/.travis.yml) just gets a tiny bit more complex.
I'll break it down:

* `docker run -t quay.io/matsen/astronaut-requests` runs commands in the `astronaut-requests` container hosted on quay.io.
* `-v ${PWD}:/astronauts` mounts the current directory as `/astronauts` inside the container
* `/bin/bash -c "..."` runs `...` as a bash command inside the container
* `/opt/conda/bin/conda run -n requests ...` runs `...` inside the `requests` Conda environment that we built in our Docker container (`conda run` is not documented as of right now on the Conda documentation, but it's lovely)
* `python /astronauts/get-astronauts.py` is the command we are running

If we look at the [Travis page for the repository](https://travis-ci.org/matsen/astronaut-requests) we can see a JSON blob at the bottom with the current astronauts in space at the bottom.


## Wrap

That's it!
In practice, you'll want Travis to build and test your code.
You can see an example of all of this working in our [libsbn](https://github.com/phylovi/libsbn) repository.

I emphasize that we used Docker as a build environment and that the code is brought in from the outside.
If you want to build a Docker container with the code built in, you can [push the resulting Docker image to a registry](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/#pushing-a-docker-image-to-a-registry).
